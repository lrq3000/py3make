# This Makefile runs tests and builds the package to upload to pypi
# To use this Makefile, pip install py3make
# then do: py3make <command>
# or: python.exe -m py3make <command>
# You also need to pip install also other required modules: `pip install flake8 coverage twine pytest pytest-cov validate-pyproject[all] pytest-xdist rstcheck` , or simply `pip install --editable .[test]`
# Up to Python 3.9 included, nosetests was used, but from 3.10 onward, support for it was dropped since it is not maintained anymore, so that pytest and pytest-cov are used instead.
# Then, cd to this folder, and type `py3make -p` to list all commands, then `py3make <command>` to run the related entry.
# To test on multiple Python versions, install them, install also the C++ redistributables for each (so that Cython works), and then type `py3make testtox`.
# CRITICAL NOTE: if you get a "FileNotFoundError" exception when trying to call @+python or @+make, then it is because you used spaces instead of a hard TABÂ character to indent! TODO: bugfix this. It happens only for @+ commands and for those after the first command (if the @+ command with spaces as indentation is the first and only statement in a command, it works!)
#
# IMPORTANT: for compatibility with `python setup.py make [alias]`, ensure:
# 1. Every alias is preceded by @[+]make (eg: @make alias)
# 2. A maximum of one @make alias or command per line
